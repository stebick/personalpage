### Welcome!

I am an epileptologist and neuroscientist studying the brain with human intracranial EEG recordings and electrical stimulation. <br/>

I earned my MD and PHD in Zurich, Switzerland, working on schizophrenia related research. I completed my intership at Jacobi Medical Center and my neurology residency at Montefiore Medical Center, both in the Bronx, NY. This was followed by a clinical and research fellowship at Stanford University. 

Since completion of the fellowship I am co-directing the [Human Brain Mapping Lab](https://hbmlab-nyc.com/) at The Feinstein Institutes, Northwell Health. In my lab we mainly work with electrical stimulation and intracranial EEG recordings from epilepsy patients to study cognitive functions such as decision making, speech perception, and memory. I am particularly interested in the role of neural oscillations in these functions.
